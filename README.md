itty bitty spider coming over to kiss your cursor

### things to improve

- improve message for users without a cursor, using media query with `pointer:fine` or `hover:hover`
- spider idle? if no mouse movement is detected for a bit, choose random points on the screen and walk around
- maybe add flies that the spider can catch
