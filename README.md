### what?

Itsy bitty spider coming over to kiss your cursor

Listen closely! for it is walking on xylophones

### how?

The whole thing is a canvas that I draw spiders onto with `requestAnimationFrame`

Footsteps are done with the web audio api. I found a list of frequencies corresponding to piano keys, and I lerp over them based on how close the spider is to the center of the screen

The whole thing is in [spider.ts](https://github.com/probablyduncan/spider-cursor/blob/main/src/spider.ts), but be warned: it's messy! Bring a broom to brush away the cobwebs

### who?

Duncan Petrie (that's me) made this. He is from here: [duncanpetrie.com](https://duncanpetrie.com).
